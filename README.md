Welcome to my Coder Academy T1A2 Portfolio! Please read below to familiarise yourself with my website.

## Purpose

I have created this website to showcase my journey and creations as I pursue a career in Web Development! In my website, I have designed all pages myself, including the Home, About Me, Projects, Blogs and Contact Me pages utilising HTML and CSS.

## Website Functionality and Features

### Colour Palette

I decided to go with a primary dark grey theme with bright accent colours like teal and pink. Other complementary colours include a pastel blue and yellow. I had initially designed for my primary to be teal and a dark colour as secondary (as shown in my wireframes), however, during the process I decided I prefer the look and feel of the colours I have chosen. I really enjoy these colours as I think they contrast nicely with the darker tone and exhibit a neon theme.

### Navigation Bar

For my website, I have attempted a modern design navbar without a background displaying my logo in the far left and all navigation links to the right. These include 'Home, About Me, Projects, Blogs and Contact'. Whilst displaying on a desktop, I have included hover effects, so the links subtely move upward and change colour. When displayed on a tablet or phone device, I have designed the navigation bar to turn collapsible, by using the checkbox function. I have also included an overlay so that viewers can click/touch anywhere on the screen to close the navbar, instead of only being able to close with the 'X' icon. 

### Footer

I have decided to implement a simple yet functional footer for my website. You will find link to my social media's including Facebook, Instagram, GitHub and LinkedIn. Below that will be a mini navigation bar, so you are able to navigate the website no matter where on the page you are. In keeping with my dark/neon theme, I have used my pink accent colour for a hover effect on the social links, making them highlight pink and move upwards when hovering over them. Upon clicking them, you will be directed to my socials that have been designed to open in a new tab.
